## Installation and Usage

#### Installation
Copy all scripts to you setting folder
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/worron/awesome-config.git ~/.config/awesome --recursive
```
and then edit `rc.lua` to select wanted config.

#### Start with Colorless
Config `rc-colorless.lua` is some kind of basic config, it consist only general features and should work without any additional editing.  You can set colorless config, set you own colors, fonts, hotkeys and then port any widget you want from colored configs.

#### Start with Colors
Colored configs is full featured setup designed to demonstrate all the power of `redflat` extension module. It contains some personal setting, so if you want to use colored config you should carefully edit "Panel widgets", "Desktop widgets", "Autostart user applications" sections, hotkeys and environment vars first.

#### Tips
Hotkeys helper bound to `Mod4`+`F1` (with holding modkey) by default, It will show you all hotkeys available at the current moment.

Theme files is very valuable part of config. Some widgets appearance can be changed dramatically with themes.

This config was designed to work with composite manager (e.g. compton).

[ACYLS](https://github.com/worron/ACYLS) icon pack is very good complement for this configs. Some widgets was designed with this pack in mind.

## Themes
Several icon packs were used to create custom WM themes:
* Any Color You Like Simple
* Open Iconic
* Android Vector Icons
